The RAMPS-RB
A RAMPS-derivative board that is specially designed for the RigidBot.

Since this will be a RAMPS derivative, it will be licensed under the GPL.  

We are starting with the following goals:
- On-board connectors for RigidBot ribbon cables
    (2x extruder, end-stops, bed heater)
- 12v supply for Arduino Mega
    (just supply 24V to RAMPS-RB)
- Integral fuse holders for (replaceable) automotive style fuses
- Compatibility with standard LCD daughter boards
    (same layout of those pins)
- New daughter board for use with RigidBot LCD
    (attaches same as others, could be used on regular RAMPS)
- Run a truly open open-source project
